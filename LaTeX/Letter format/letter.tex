Respected Sir,  \par \bigskip

I apologise for not being able to make it for the first mid examinations that were held in the month of feburary, 2021, as I had an asthama attack, being a patient of chronic stable asthama. I will make sure that this situation does not happen again, or if it does, i'll make sure you are informed about it. Kindly consider to re-conduct the 1st mid examination for me. \par \bigskip

Sincerely, \par \smallskip
